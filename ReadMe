I solved Medium Question no 2 out of 9 questions in the C++ programming language 
Explanation:- I solve this problem using unordered_map we can also use a map but there is no need to sorting and if we use a map instant of unordered_map then the Time Complexity is more.
Create a Unordered_map to store key-value pair, i.e. element-frequency pair.
Traverse the array from start to end.  For each element in the array insert the element in unordered_map and increase its freq by 1.
if the count of frq is >n/3 then push_back in ans  vector.
print vector.
